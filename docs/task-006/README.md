# 📖 Overview

This task automates the **Text Box Submission** functionality of the **DemoQA** web application using **Playwright with JavaScript**.

The automation verifies that a user can successfully fill all required fields, submit the form, and validate the submitted data displayed on the page.

The framework follows **Page Object Model (POM)**, **Data-Driven Testing (JSON Test Data)**, reusable **BasePage**, and industry-standard automation practices.

# 🎯 Objective

Verify that users can submit the Text Box form successfully and validate all displayed values.
